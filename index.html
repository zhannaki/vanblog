                        <h4>My dear old Bernard,</h4>
                        <p>This time you deserve bigger compliments for the little croquis of the two Breton women in your letter than for the other 6,
                            since the little croquis has a great style.1 I’m behind myself as far as croquis go, being so totally absorbed these recent
                            superb days with square no. 30 canvases, which wear me out considerably and I intend to use to decorate the house.
                            You will have received my letter explaining the serious reasons for advising you to try to persuade your father to give you a little
                            more freedom as far as your purse is concerned, should he pay your fare to Arles. I believe that you would repay him through your work.
                            And that way you would stay longer with Gauguin, and leaving to do your service, you would leave for a good artistic campaign.
                            If your father had a son who was a prospector and discoverer of raw gold among the pebbles and on the pavement, your father would certainly not look down on that talent.
                            Now in my opinion, you have absolutely the equivalent of that.
                        </p>

                        <h4>My dear Theo</h4>
                        <p>At last I’m sending you a little croquis to give you at least an idea of the direction the work is taking.
                            Because today I’ve gone back to it.</p>
                        <p>My eyes are still tired, but anyway I had a new idea in mind, and here’s the croquis of it. No. 30 canvas once again.</p>
                        <p>This time it’s simply my bedroom, but the colour has to do the job here, and through its being
                            simplified by giving a grander style to things, to be suggestive here of rest or of sleep in general.
                            In short, looking at the painting should rest the mind, or rather, the imagination.</p>
                        <p>The walls are of a pale violet. The floor — is of red tiles.
                            The bedstead and the chairs are fresh butter yellow.
                            The sheet and the pillows very bright lemon green.
                            The blanket scarlet red.
                            The window green.</p>

                        <h4>My dear Gauguin,</h4>
                        <p>Thanks for your letter, and thanks most of all for your promise to come as early as the twentieth.
                            Agreed, this reason that you give2 won’t help to make a pleasure trip of the train journey, and it’s only right
                            that you should put off your journey until you can do it without it being a bloody nuisance. But that apart,
                            I almost envy you this trip, which will show you, en passant, miles and miles of countryside of different kinds with
                            autumn splendours.
                        </p>
                        <p>I still have in my memory the feelings that the journey from Paris to Arles gave me this past winter.
                            How I watched out to see ‘if it was like Japan yet’! Childish, isn’t it?
                            Look here, I wrote to you the other day that my vision was strangely tired. Well, I rested for two and a half days, and then
                            I got back to work. But not yet daring to go outside, I did, for my decoration once again, a no. 30 canvas of my bedroom with the whitewood furniture that you know.
                            Ah, well, it amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat.

                        <h4>My dear Theo,</h4>
                        <p>Thank you for your letter and for the 50-franc note it contained. Thank you for having written me more about those Dutch artists’ painting.</p>
                        <p>I’ve had gas put in, in the studio and the kitchen, which is costing me 25 francs for installation. If Gauguin and
                            I work every evening for a fortnight, won’t we earn it all back again? But since, what’s more, G. may come any day now,
                            I’ll absolutely absolutely need at least another 50 francs.</p>
                        <p>I’m not ill, but I’d become so without any doubt if I didn’t take hearty food and if I didn’t stop painting for a few days.
                            In fact, I’m once again nearly reduced to the state of madness of Hugo van der Goes in Emile Wauters’s painting.
                            And if it wasn’t for the fact that I had something of a dual nature, something of both the monk and the painter,
                            I should be — and that long since — utterly and entirely reduced to the above-mentioned state.</p>

                        <p>I did know that Gauguin had travelled, but I didn’t know he was a real seaman; he’s been through all the difficulties,
                            he was a real topman on the topmast and a real sailor. That gives me a tremendous respect for him, and an even more
                            absolute confidence in his personality. He has — if he’s to be compared with something — links with those Icelandic
                            fishermen of Loti’s. I believe that it’ll make the same impression on you as on me.
                            Now we’ve done some work already, of course; he has a negress on the go, and a big landscape of this region.

                        <h4>My dear Theo,</h4>
                        <p>I’ve received a letter from Mr E. Dujardin regarding the exhibition of some canvases of mine in his dark hole.
                            I find it so disgusting to pay for the planned exhibition with a canvas that in reality there aren’t two answers to
                            this gentleman’s letter. There’s one, and you’ll find it enclosed. Only I’m sending it to you and not to him so that you know my
                            thoughts and so that you can simply tell him that I’ve changed my mind and haven’t the slightest desire to exhibit at this moment.
                            It’s no use at all getting angry with the chap, it’s better to be tritely polite.</p>
                        <p>So no exhibition at the Revue Indépendante, I make so bold as to believe that Gauguin is of the same opinion.
                            In any case he doesn’t at all urge me to do it. We’ve hardly ever exhibited, have we?
                            There were a few canvases at Tanguy’s place first of all, at Thomas’s and then at Martin’s.
