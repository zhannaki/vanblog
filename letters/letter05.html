                <p>My dear Theo,</p>
                Thank you for your money order for 50 francs, which I’ve just received.
                I did know that Gauguin had travelled, but I didn’t know he was a real seaman; he’s been through all the difficulties, he was a real topman on the topmast and a real sailor.2 That gives me a tremendous respect for him, and an even more absolute confidence in his personality. He has — if he’s to be compared with something — links with those Icelandic fishermen of Loti’s.3 I believe that it’ll make the same impression on you as on me.
                Now we’ve done some work already, of course; he has a negress on the go, and a big landscape of this region.
                What he tells me about Brittany is very interesting, and Pont-Aven is a quite amazing part of the world. Of course, everything there is better, bigger, more beautiful than here. Of a more solemn character, and above all more of a whole and more defined than the small, stunted, scorched countryside of Provence. Be that as it may, he, like me, nevertheless likes what he sees, and is particularly intrigued by the Arlésiennes.  1v:2
                This week I did a new study of a sower; the landscape utterly flat, the figure small and blurred.5
                Then I did another study of ploughed field with the stump of an old yew. Like this

                <p><u>Ever yours,</u></p>
                <p><u>Vincent</u></p>
